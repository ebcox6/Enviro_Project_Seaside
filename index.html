        <h1>Environmental Project: Biomimicry and Children's Book</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Environmental Project website! This project focuses on understanding local and global environmental issues, applying biomimicry as an innovative solution, and creating a children's book to educate others about these environmental challenges.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Students will work through a series of workshops, learning about local and global environmental issues, comparing different solutions, and using nature as inspiration to create innovative solutions. The final product will be a children's book, designed to teach young readers (2nd grade level or below) about environmental problems and how nature can inspire solutions.</p>

            <li><strong>Comparative Analysis and Storyboarding (Weeks 2-4):</strong> Students use Venn diagrams to compare local and global issues and create storyboards for their children's book.</li>
            <li><strong>Biomimicry Integration (Week 5):</strong> Students learn about biomimicry and integrate a nature-inspired solution into their story.</li>
            <li><strong>Book Development (Weeks 6-7):</strong> Students create their final product, either digitally or physically, with illustrations and engaging storytelling.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Presentation and Reflection (Week 7):</strong> Students present their book to a 2nd-grade audience and reflect on their learning process.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Grading and Evaluation</h2>
